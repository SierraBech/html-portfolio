<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am currently learning through Udemy courses and a number of resource websites like for example,
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN Web Docs</a>, and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3 Schools Online</a>. 
   I enjoy the thought of helping someone take their small business and transfer it to a simple and beautiful website that fulfills the 
   customers and business needs.
</p>
<p>In my spare time, I work on a number of art projects, play with my cat Azalea, and enjoy trying different kinds of teas!</p>
