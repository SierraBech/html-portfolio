   <h3>Emperor`s New Groove</h3>
   A movie I can watch over and over again and never get tired of it. It`s hilarious and witty and the theme song is such a catch!

   <h3>Drop Dead Fred</h3>
    <p>This movie reminds me of my childhood and I love it for that reason. It`s quite a funny movie as well.</p>
   <h3>Stranger Than Fiction</h3>
    <p>I love this movie because it`s an awesome idea to bring a book to life and I love all the actors in that movie.</p>
